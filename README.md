Welcome to PAHO's ProEthos repository!
======================================

ProEthos is a web-based platform for the ethics review of human subjects research. Developed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME) in collaboration with the Pontifical Catholic University of Paran√° (Brazil), ProEthos aims to improve the quality of the ethics review process, ultimately enhancing protections for research participants.

ProEthos allows researchers to submit their studies to for ethics review electronically. Committees then review protocols with the help of tools and processes built into the platform. They can also monitor approved studies, report to external entities, and feed clinical trial registries.

Institutions must download their own secure version of ProEthos to their own server or cloud-based server (instructions and code detailed below). This gives institutions full control over their users and data, along with the ability to modify the platform or integrate it with other systems as needed.

PAHO/BIREME does not offer individualized technical support to institutions that install ProEthos, but releases periodic updates to fix bugs and improve usability. Questions and/or bugs can be posted to the network of ProEthos users in the GitHub issues forum (which includes answers to many commonly-asked installation questions).

Please visit PAHO's ProEthos site for a more detailed description of the platform, introductory videos and FAQs: https://www.paho.org/en/bioethics/proethos
